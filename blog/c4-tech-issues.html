          <h4>Women in Tech</h4>
          <p>I may be biased, since I am a woman attempting to enter the tech industry, but I have the facts to back it up: women are terribly underrepresented! However, things are looking up. The question I wonder, is why are women so underrepresented in computer-related fields?</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">NPR did an interesting story</a> analyzing a part of that question and came up with some interesting data. Women and men had similar interest in computer science studies right up until the mid 80s. Why? This is when personal computers entered the market and became popular. OK, so what? Well, as personal computers entered the market, their marketing campaigns entered American homes. And those marketing campaigns almost singularly targeted men and boys.</p>
          <p>So how do we counter act? I think the key is to start early. Some great new projects are emerging aimed at encouraging young girls to develop their skills, thought processes, and interest in STEM-related areas. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz7g4qy0l9M">GoldieBlox</a> are one of those such products. How cool!</p>
