      <h2>Margin/Border/Padding</h2>
        <h5>01/23/2015</h5>
          <p>After the Chrome Dev Tools Challenge, I really started to get a hang of the difference between margins, border, and padding in CSS. Being able to play around live on the page made it so easy to visually see the difference it made right in front of me.</p>
          <h4>Margin</h4>
          <p>Margins seem to be the outermost layer surrounding an object. It defines the amount of space between an object and its surroundings. You can set an objects margins in many ways, such as auto, or you can specify specific sides of an element (top, right...). You can also either use a unit of measure, like px, to define the amount of space or you can use a percentage to define the space relative to the entire page.</p>
          <h4>Border</h4>
          <p>Borders outline the object itself. It can literally outline it like a box around the object or you can skip using actual lines. Borders contain the object and separate it on the page from other objects. You can add some style besides spacing here by defining the style, color, or strength of the border line if you like.</p>
          <h4>Padding</h4>
          <p>Padding is the most interesting to me and I sitll have more to learn about all the ways to use padding. It seems to be space within the edges of the object itself to create a kidn of bubble around the content. The space added by padding would sit within any border you might define. So I imagine this would work well if you wanted a lot of space between the content and the line of the border.</p>
