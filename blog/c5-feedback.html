      <h2>Feedback time!</h2>

          <h4>Pairing</h4>
            <p>Pairing has been a bit anxiety inducing for me. I just anticipate being judged for my lack of knowledge, particularly if I'm feeling behind at that moment. But I've found that during a pair, I learn the most and am absolutely more productive. Occasionally my pair and I are not terribly productive but this is usually for lack of preparedness. But what is always rewarding is when I go into a pair prepared, but anxious, and yet I perform really well throughout the pair and end up feeling super confident. I just always go into a pair hoping I can give the other person as much as I always get out of pairing from them.</p>
          <h4>Feedback</h4>
            <p>Oddly, I feel much less anxious about getting feedback from pairing sessions. You would think it would be the most obvious thing to be anxious about: hearing exactly, honestly how the other person felt you handled the pair. Yet, I usually feel I have a good idea of how I did for myself immediately after. It turns out I'm more anxious about how I feel the pair went. It also is interesting to see their perspective since I find I'm much harder on myself than anyone else is. But I do enjoy getting constructive, actionable feedback. It gives me something to grow with and work on.</p>
            <p>Writing feedback has been interesting. I found I end up wanting to spend most of the paragraph giving myself feedback and in turn apologizing to the other person for my failures and flaws than actually giving them feedback on how they did. It's something I recognized right away and try to curb. It's just not useful! And that's something I'm learning as well; focussing so much on my faults is just counter-productive. I build too many silly barriers emotionally for myself and I need to break through!</p>
