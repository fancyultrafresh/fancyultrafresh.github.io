      <h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
        <h5>11/04/2014</h5>
          <p>Watching the Fireside chat was a very interesting perspective on how to approach any learning experience - not just DevBootcamp. The kitchen versus table mentality touches on an aspect of confidence, really, that doesn't come naturally to someone like me who often waits for direction, feedback, and validation. When one takes charge of whatever the situation is, in this case their education, they find direction quickly, they find solutions, they find peers, and they find that others tend to respect them for it.</p>

          <p>This idea of working together towards an individual goal we happen to all be striving for, more or less, is doable when we bring this kind of respect and passion to the "kitchen" (rather than the table).</p>

          <p>This idea also gives me more confidence about the DevBootcamp experience and what I can expect. More importantly, it gave me a better idea of what I should expect of myself, which I now think is what will be most important. What can I bring to this experience, what can I contribute, what can I inspire? Rather than expecting to go sit in a chair and have DevBootcamp simply pour knowledge into my head, as if I'm a customer in a restaurant waiting for the waiter to come by and fill my water glass, I will attempt to go into the experience being another chef in the kitchen.</p>
