<h2>Phase 0 Week 1</h2>

<em>Gitty-up</em>

<p>November 2nd 2014</p>

<p>I'll start this blog in a pretty boring way: by answering the questions laid out in this challenge in a (hopefully) straightforward way.

What are the benefits of version control? Version control is a beautiful way to edit a file since it allows you to track the changes made, when they were made, who made them, and therefore help you understand why. It saves these changes as different versions of the same file so that you can access when and how the changes were made in case of mistakes made, to investigate the origins of changes made, or see how a file changed over time.

How does git help you keep track of changes? Git helps keep track of changes to a file by saving all versions of a file, assigning these versions labels, and allowing users to access these changes. It also has a slightly lengthy process to fully add these changes to the "main" file with a 3 stage process. This allows you to save and work with changes without altering the "main" file if you don't need to.

Why use GitHub to store your code? GitHub is a great tool for not only version control but for multiple contributors to make changes simultaneously to a file. It allows the use of remote repositories for changes which help separate the changes so that they don't affect each other negatively and only merge when told to. Then, instead of potentially cancelling each other out, it helps merge them so that they work together.

Overall, git and GitHub add redundancy to a process that could only benefit from it. Did you know the human brain develops many redundant pathways between neurons in your cortex? While we still don't know so many things about the incredible complexities of the brain, one thing we do know is that redundancy is a wonderful safeguard for keeping the important systems running when things go wrong.</p>
